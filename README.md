## Project Overview  
This repository contains the code, data, and manuscript for our study on **FIRST-seq**. Our approach leverages **customised nanopore direct cDNA sequencing** to investigate reverse transcriptase fingerprints and determine RNA secondary structures in long read sequencing reads. 

## Installation  
###  **Clone this repository** 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/RNA-Nanopore-Analysis.git
cd RNA-Nanopore-Analysis
```

###  **Set up dependencies** 

Ensure R and required packages are installed. We use renv for reproducibility.

Install key dependencies manually:

```R
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "data.table", "Biostrings", "Seurat"))
```
